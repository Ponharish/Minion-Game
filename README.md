# Minion-Game
This is a fun, simple game I developed in December 2022. The game features a GUI built using Python's Tkinter module.

## Inspiration
The inspiration for this project came from a reel I saw, where a user had to fill out a form, and the submit button could only be clicked once all data validation had passed (if not the button would randomly relocate to another location within the form). This ingenious idea drove me to research and think about developing something based on it. During that period in 2022, I was quite obsessed with Minions after watching the movie Minions - The Rise of Gru. All these factors motivated me to start writing code for this project, which turned out to work as expected.

## How to Play
The game is very simple and straightforward to play:

1. **Choose a Character:** Start by choosing your desired character (a Minion).
2. **Start the Game:** Once the game starts (when the music begins playing), try to move the mouse over the Minion and right-click on it to catch it.
3. **Score Points:** Each successful catch gives you 10 points.
4. **Be Quick:** You have to be fast in catching them, as the Minion will relocate to another location after you move the cursor near it.
5. **Increasing Intensity:** As the score increases, the intensity of the game also increases.
6. **No Limits:** There is no time limit or maximum score in this game.

Enjoy playing!
